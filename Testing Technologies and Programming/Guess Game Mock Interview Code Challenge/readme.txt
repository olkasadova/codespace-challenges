Guess game rules:
1. The random number will be generate in range 0-100 including
2. negative numbers will be consedered as an error
3. To make the game more interesting you will have only 5 attempts

Three stages of development:
1. Create an html form 
    - with input field for user
    - button to Generate a new number
    - button to campare your results
2. Create an output showing
    - your number entered
    - result showing your attempt and if it is lower/higher or equal to the generated number
3. Write JS function that generates a number
4. Write JS function that compares numbers
5. Write funcion that calculates your attempt
6. Add validations for the range, non-numeric input, max length of the input, special symbols

6. If everything works OK do better styling of the form
